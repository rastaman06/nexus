# Nexus

Nexus is a framework for the development of distributed applications
(including, but not limited to, massively multiplayer online games).

It is implemented in the Java language, though it is designed to be usable with
JavaScript-based clients via the Google Web Toolkit Java to JavaScript
compiler.

It is currently extremely unfinished.
